  abstract={This paper studies the online correlated selection (OCS) problem. It was introduced by Fahrbach, Huang, Tao, and Zadimoghaddam (2020) to obtain the first edge-weighted online bipartite matching algorithm that breaks the $0.5$ barrier. Suppose that we receive a pair of elements in each round and immediately select one of them. Can we select with negative correlation to be more effective than independent random selections? Our contributions are threefold. For semi-OCS, which considers the probability that an element remains unselected after appearing in $k$ rounds, we give an optimal algorithm that minimizes this probability for all $k$. It leads to $0.536$-competitive unweighted and vertex-weighted online bipartite matching algorithms that randomize over only two options in each round, improving the $0.508$-competitive ratio by Fahrbach et al. (2020). Further, we develop the first multi-way semi-OCS that allows an arbitrary number of elements with arbitrary masses in each round. As an application, it rounds the Balance algorithm in unweighted and vertex-weighted online bipartite matching and is $0.593$-competitive. Finally, we study OCS, which further considers the probability that an element is unselected in an arbitrary subset of rounds. We prove that the optimal "level of negative correlation" is between $0.167$ and $0.25$, improving the previous bounds of $0.109$ and $1$ by Fahrbach et al. (2020). Our OCS gives a $0.519$-competitive edge-weighted online bipartite matching algorithm, improving the previous $0.508$-competitive ratio by Fahrbach et al. (2020).},

  abstract={Approximate Competitive Equilibrium from Equal Incomes (A-CEEI) is an equilibrium-based solution concept for fair division of discrete items to agents with combinatorial demands. In theory, it is known that in asymptotically large markets: 1. For incentives, the A-CEEI mechanism is Envy-Free-but-for-Tie-Breaking (EF-TB), which implies that it is Strategyproof-in-the-Large (SP-L). 2. From a computational perspective, computing the equilibrium solution is unfortunately a computationally intractable problem (in the worst-case, assuming PPAD$\neq$ FP). We develop a new heuristic algorithm that outperforms the previous state-of-the-art by multiple orders of magnitude. This new, faster algorithm lets us perform experiments on real-world inputs for the first time. We discover that with real-world preferences, even in a realistic implementation that satisfies the EF-TB and SP-L properties, agents may have surprisingly simple and plausible deviations from truthful reporting of preferences. To this end, we propose a novel strengthening of EF-TB, which dramatically reduces the potential for strategic deviations from truthful reporting in our experiments. A (variant of) our algorithm is now in production: on real course allocation problems it is much faster, has zero clearing error, and has stronger incentive properties than the prior state-of-the-art implementation.},
