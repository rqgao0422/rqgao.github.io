I am a first-year Ph.D. student at Computer Science Department, Stanford University. My research interests broadly lie in theoretical computer science, in particular in algorithms and game theory. 
<!-- Currently, I am on the First-Year Research Rotation Program and fortunate to be rotating with Prof. Mose Charikar.  -->

Prior to that, I received my B.Eng. from [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/), Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University. During that period, I am fortunate to have worked with Prof. [Zhiyi Huang](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~zhiyi/) at University of Hong Kong and Prof. [Aviad Rubinstein](https://cs.stanford.edu/~aviad/) at Stanford University.

My curriculum vitae is [here](../assets/pdf/CV.pdf).
