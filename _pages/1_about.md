I am a senior-year undergraduate student at [Yao Class](https://iiis.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/yaoclass/), Institute for Interdisciplinary Information Sciences, Tsinghua University. My research interests broadly lie in theoretical computer science, in particular in algorithmic game theory and online algorithms. I am fortunate to have worked with Prof. [Zhiyi Huang](https://i.cs.hku.hk/~zhiyi/) at University of Hong Kong and Prof. [Aviad Rubinstein](https://cs.stanford.edu/~aviad/) at Stanford University.

I am applying for graduate school now!
